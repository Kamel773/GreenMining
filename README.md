Over the last few years, SO has become quite popular and thneumber of questions posted has increased exponentially. The number of posts on Android and IOS mobile application(apps) development has seen a linear trend in SO. Many of these questions are related to battery consumption, improving power consumption efficiency of mobile applications and other green related questions. In this paper, we extracted posts from Stack Overflow which are related to green related questions and answers on Android and IOS development. We extensively studied the data and came up with various guidelines for extracting green posts from SO and also an extensive analysis on the extracted green posts.
